<h1 align="center">Tinder Clone âœ¨ Swipe !</h1>

This a Full stack application built using MERN. MondoDb, Expresse, React, and Node. 

I use JWT for the authentification system, and it has a lot of very interesting and complicated functionalities. First and foremost, the chat function. Users inside can actively exchange messages if they have matched with one another. Naturally, there is also a matching algorithm depending on specific interests, age, and things like that.

You can create your own unique and specific profile. An interesting bio, profile image, age, gender, and your prefered gender. It has real-time notifications, and a very dynamic Swiping features that is perfectly operational and easy on the eyes.

Just like last time, this project isn't deployed into any sort of website, but I'll make sure to include both a video and plenty of screenshots to showcase the functionalities mentioned.
